# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Registered on freeCodeCamp, started reviewing HTML with the Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5, 


**Thoughts:** My first goal with this challenge is to make my blog more personalized and to stop using Wordpress themes. I am a little overwhelmed and tired because I got 5 hours of sleep but I'm chugging through it. While coding, I am watching a dungeons and dragons tutorial.. Does this make me a nerd?
